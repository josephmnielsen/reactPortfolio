              Hello!
            </p>
            <p>
              I am 36 years old and have 15+ years of relatable experience. I attended culinary school in London, UK and became a private chef upon graduation in 2006. For the next 10 years I worked my way through the food and beverage industry, spending 6 of those years running a successful Italian restaurant in the San Francisco Bay Area.
            </p>

            <p className="a3">
              As the F&B industry ground to a halt in Spring 2020 I decided it was time to seek out new opportunities and pursue another passion, coding. I have been working with HTML and CSS for 18 years and have greatly developed my skills in JavaScript, JQuery, Node, React, MySql, Mongo, and APIs.
            </p>

            <p>
              I am available for free-lance, contract, and full-time work. Have a look through my portfolio and contact me via the routes provided!
